# Catering Business Platform Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project was undertaken as part of the SYD366 course. Our objective was to analyze various software solutions to find the most suitable one for a fictional catering and food truck business owned by "Jason". The project involved detailed research, analysis, and a presentation of our findings to our professor who acted as the business owner.

## Project Goals
- **Identify the best catering business management software** for Jason's needs, emphasizing financial management, client data security, and operational efficiency.
- **Develop a comprehensive understanding** of how different software platforms cater to the specific needs of food service businesses.
- **Provide a detailed software recommendation** that demonstrates our understanding of business operations, client requirements, and software capabilities.

## Methodology
1. **Software Evaluation Criteria Development**: Created a list of essential features and performance metrics.
2. **Market Research**: Conducted in-depth research on different software options.
3. **Analysis and Comparison**: Compared software features, usability, cost, and support services to find the best match.
4. **UML Diagramming**: Utilized Visual Paradigm to create UML diagrams illustrating potential software integration with business processes.
5. **Presentation and Reporting**: Compiled findings into a detailed presentation, which was delivered to our professor.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Visual Paradigm**: For creating UML diagrams.
- **Microsoft PowerPoint**: For crafting the final presentation.
- **Google Docs**: For collaborative report generation and documentation.

## Key Learnings
- Gained a deep understanding of assessing software based on business-specific needs.
- Enhanced skills in UML diagram creation and system design documentation.
- Strengthened project management and teamwork abilities through effective collaboration and task division.

### Sequence Diagrams
Sequence diagrams are used to show the interactions over time that the software performs in response to user actions or system events. Below are two key processes depicted via sequence diagrams.

#### Create Ingredient Information
This diagram details the process flow when a user adds new ingredient information to the system.
